# PerlinNoise
A recreation of Ken Perlin's perlin noise. it generates a 255 by 255 field of values. each point on the map has a value between -1 and 1. The values are random, but two values next to each other hava almost the same values. Perlin Noise is used for ranodm world generatoin. I'm working on a 3 dimentional version, which works just like this one but with a 255 by 255 by 255 range of values.
